# TBD
## Dealing with the winners
- winners leaderboard
- easter egg with grey mare for extra prize
- another bot (or the same with the admin panel) to send messages to the winners and view leaderboard.
- the ability to contact through the bot the ones who finished the game

## Scoring system
- finding the best ending - 150 or something
- finding good ending - 100
- plus all the remaining resources (remove random changes to stats)
- divide total points by number of attempts
